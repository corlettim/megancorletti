## GatorGrader

As I talked about previously, I have worked on GatorGrader. GatorGrader is an
automated testing tool that helps students know what should be accomplished
within a lab and/or practical that is assigned by the professor. While this is
a tool that is made by students and built by students, it allows professors
to also have a tool to assist in grading. I, personally, have worked with professors
in my department to add features to the tool that are fulfilling their needs
that they need for their students. Also with GatorGrader, I have worked on creating
solution and starter repositories which means I have edited and created YAML files
that link directly to what checks are necessary for the labs and practicals.
GatorGrader is also an open-source project which has opened my eyes to working on
something that is getting contributions from people who I have not worked with
directly but can learn from.

## Corletti's Cup Website

Considering that I have taken a Web Development class, I had a final project that
had to be complete. My idea stemmed from my love for coffee and the fact that I
am on the Executive Board of Grounds for Change, a non profit student run organization.
However, this soon became a fun project that could become a reality. My brother
and I had always wanted to start a business and this was the perfect opportunity.
Because of this, my brother and I have begun roasting our own beans and improving
the website with what we find necessary for our business to grow. It is an experience
like this that shows how inspiring computer science can be to the world and the
people in it with blossoming ideas. If you would like to check out Corletti's Cup,
