## GatorGrader

As I talked about previously, I have worked on GatorGrader. GatorGrader is an
automated testing tool that helps students know what should be accomplished
within a lab and/or practical that is assigned by the professor. While this is
a tool that is made by students and built by students, it allows professors
to also have a tool to assist in grading. I, personally, have worked with professors
in my department to add features to the tool that are fulfilling their needs
that they need for their students. Also with GatorGrader, I have worked on creating
solution and starter repositories which means I have edited and created YAML files
that link directly to what checks are necessary for the labs and practicals.
GatorGrader is also an open-source project which has opened my eyes to working on
something that is getting contributions from people who I have not worked with
directly but can learn from.
