Oh hello there! How's it going? My name is Megan Corletti! I am currently a Junior
at Allegheny College. I am a computer science major with a Math and Education
double minor. My life is hectic but if you take a peek at my tags below, they will
give you a hint that I give love and smiles to everything I do. Below is the story
of just how I got involved with Computer Science and how it became an essential
part of my career.
<!-- excerpt -->
I am a computer scientist.
Developer interested in web development for small businesses.

The only way I was every going to take a Computer Science class is if someone
forced me to do it. Clearly, that happened because I have now completed 4 classes
and part of 3 classes and will continue on this path to complete the Computer
Science major. Now, this is my highlight because the person that forced me to keep
going with Computer Science has made the biggest impact on my learning experience.
He taught me to fall in love with coding even if I tried not to. This “he” I speak
of was my TA from day one and he would urge me to try harder and showed me a side
of coding that I had never seen before. The side that made him fall in love with
it even though it may have caused him stress, anger, and fatigue. Creating that
initial relationship with someone through computer science, made me realize that
computer science is more than coding. It brings people together and creates a unique
relationship because there is a way of communication unlike any other. Which influences
me to want to follow the path into web development for small businesses because
that gets people involved with computer science in a minimalistic way that is fun
and cute.

The GatorGrader project has helped me become unique and (mildly) employable
through its complexity.

It has taught me how to work as a software engineer in the production world and
sometimes employees might not have that experience. The unique aspect that I have
is that working on GatorGrader has allowed me to look a computer science from a
different perspective because I have worked on the documentation side which
usually is done by the heads of the company rather than one of the new employees.
It has also given the the expertise of working with people in a small development
group and adopting different ideas for ways of coding. It allows me to know that
there are different approaches to coding which shows its versatility and some
people have the idea that coding is “one way or the highway” so therefore, my
knowledge of its versatility makes me unique and employable.

All of this work I could have never imagined myself doing and I constantly question
if it is the right thing to do but here I am making impacts on the future of coding
and that is why I am Megan Corletti, Maybe Coding?
