## At Allegheny

Second semester of my sophomore year I was asked to join a development team in the
Computer Science department at Allegheny College as an independent study. This development
team was building and creating an automated testing tool. This tool was going to be used
to check and grade labs and practical assignments that would be handed out to
students. The automated testing tool is called GatorGrader! If you would like
to learn more about GatorGrader, feel free to check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader)!

Because of GatorGrader, my experience with development and improvement has skyrocketed.
Listed below are titles and jobs I have acquired because of the independent study
I was so grateful for.

## Outside of Allegheny

Outside of Allegheny and the Computer Science Department, I have had experience
coaching, guarding, and training. Out of these jobs, while all inspiring,
coaching has been the most rewarding of them all. For the last 3 years, I have
been the assistant coach of the Park Sharks. The Park Sharks is a summer swim
team that encourages the development and improvement in the techniques and love
of swimming. As the assistant coach, I have written practices for swimmers ages 7-18,
lead practices, and managed swim meets. Consequently, from my coaching experience,
I have led my own one on one swim lessons with kids who are beginning to learn
the basics of swimming. I also started a program called the Junior Sharks which
allows kids ages 2-6 to learn the fundamentals of swimming in a group setting.
As mentioned, as side from coaching, I have guarded and trained. I have bee the
Head Guard at a swim pool which allowed me to maintain the pool facility, finances,
and trained new guards. This position has given me a lot of responsibility and
the means for knowing how to work under pressure and upholding maturity in a
public setting.
