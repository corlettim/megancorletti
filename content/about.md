## At Allegheny

Second semester of my sophomore year I was asked to join a development team in the
Computer Science department at Allegheny College as an independent study. This development
team was building and creating an automated testing tool. This tool was going to be used
to check and grade labs and practical assignments that would be handed out to
students. The automated testing tool is called GatorGrader! If you would like
to learn more about GatorGrader, feel free to check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader)!

Because of GatorGrader, my experience with development and improvement has skyrocketed.
Listed below are titles and jobs I have acquired because of the independent study
I was so grateful for.
