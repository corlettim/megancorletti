My site build process started on a smooth note by going to Netlify and finding a template that
best fit my personality. After connecting and deploying, I went about by finding a
file that seems easy enough to change and make some edits. This allowed me to
understand the flow of the website and what pages were connected to what markdown
or HTML files. The first challenge that I ran into was finding or manipulating the
CSS code that allowed this template to look so pretty. Sadly it did not come with
any CSS and the Developer Tools in Google Chrome did not allow for changes. Therefore,
I was instructed to over ride the color of my page within the pages.html.slim file.
This worked an allowed me to make my website match a little better and make it
more Megan Corletti like. Another issue I fought with for about a week,
was my resume link. I could not get it to work for the life of me but finally I
realized that I did not need to create a new images folder and there already was one.

My audience is anyone that wants to get to know me beyond the computer but maybe
before the interview. Its been apparent that in the computer science world, Technical
interviews are first and then if you do good enough, you get the real deal interview.
While nothing is wrong with that, I am someone that needs that personal connection and
talking ability to show what I am really capable of. Sometimes what happens in text
editors or terminals is not accurate of what I can do for you.

The documents I hav completed this semester have helped with my website tremendously.
I realized that these articles that I have written or read, were really just the puzzle
pieces. The website brought them together. I was able to use my Developer Narrative,
as well as understand what skill base to get across from looking at job listings
and seeing what they have to offer. Also, the resume building helped without a doubt
since I was able to confidently attach an image of mine that companies can Download
if that is what they want.
